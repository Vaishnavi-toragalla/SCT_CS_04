Interactive Typing Area - Keystroke Logger Example
This project demonstrates a basic web application where users can type into a textarea, and the keystrokes are logged in real time. This project is designed for educational purposes to showcase how to capture and display user input in a controlled and ethical manner.

Features
Capture and display keystrokes typed in a textarea.
Visually styled interface with modern design.
Real-time key logging for educational purposes.
Aesthetic Enhancements
Improved design with a clean and modern UI.
Responsive styling for a pleasant user experience across devices.
Button to display the typed keystrokes in a designated area on the page.

How It Works
Keystroke Logging:
The program captures each key pressed while typing in the textarea using the keydown event. Every key press is stored in an array keyLogs.

Display Keystrokes:
When the "Show Keystrokes" button is clicked, the logged keystrokes are displayed in the #logs section on the page.

Console Logging (optional):
For development purposes, the keypresses are also logged to the browser's console to visualize what is being captured in real time.

Ethical Considerations
This project is built with the intention to educate about event handling and user input capture. It's essential to use such techniques responsibly and with full user consent. Ensure that any form of input logging is transparent and for valid use cases, such as improving user experiences or learning purposes in a controlled environment.

Important:
This program is meant to be used only for ethical, educational purposes.
It should not be used for malicious activities or in ways that could violate user privacy or security.
